# This script uses Wine to build the Windows installer executables under a
# restricted user account. A temporary directory contains both a clone of
# the installer repos and the Wine prefix used to build. It is removed after
# the build to make it difficult for state to persist between builds.
#
# Commands are executed as the Wine user via SSH, so passwordless SSH login with
# authorized_keys may be helpful. Wine GUI elements are surpressed with xvfb.
#
# After the build the executables are signed, and then there is a confirmation
# prompt for release.
#
# The following files should be in the releaseDirectory:
#
# * dependencies/bcprov-jdk15on-154.jar -   https://bouncycastle.org/download/bcprov-jdk15on-154.jar
# * dependencies/isetup-5.5.9-unicode.exe -   http://www.jrsoftware.org/download.php/is-unicode.exe
# * dependencies/jsign-1.3-SNAPSHOT.jar -   build from https://github.com/ebourg/jsign
# * freenet.jar                         -   Whatever's pointed at by https://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/freenet-stable-latest.jar.url
